# BFF of SCSU--- an App for SCSU students

# BFFOfSCSU

   Overview about this project:
The purpose of this project is to serve all students of SCSU. Because I found a fact 
that there is no one good mobile app for our students of SCSU, which can provide 
students' real needs, such as Professors' office hours, free resources (open time for
free parking, free swimming, free movies, free skating, etc) and important notification
(about safety, job fair, events, news etc). We can find those kinds of info from websites
or email or professors' office, which is so inconvient for us. This project will attempt to 
collect and refine the most necessary info from different places. The basic idea is to make
students to easily find what they want and what they need.
	
	Functionalities of the project:
	1. Office Hour: this module will satisfy students' need to meet professors. 
When the office hour icon is touched, the list of professors they may want to meet will show up. To
click any one will show the professor's office hour schedule. At the starting using this
project, user can get their professor list item by searching the DB. The app will remember
their records, and automatically list the most important first 10 professors for the user.

	2. Free Resource: this module will provide the free resources of SCSU to the students.
The app will remember users' clicking record, and send notification of their most concerning
to them.

	3. Event News: this module will show users imformation of important events and news.
Some notification of some special office, such as Public Safety Center, Career office, Student Union, Ticket office,
etc.

	4. Me: This module is to register account and their information for users.
In the back end, app will analyze those info and users' action record info, and then find what kinds of service is best
for each different user.

	5. Search and setting: basic search and setting option.
Users can search what they want from the app DB or from google DB.

	Introduction of the current version
The current version is just a prototype which completed some basic functions. This version is 
for users' experience and we hope that we can collect some feedback from the users.

	Future Plan
This project will be kept going, and the first release will be posted on Google Store once 
the development team think that it satisfy the basic needs of our customers. Once the app is 
accepted by students, we believe that the most students will install it. At that time, we 
will do some commercial things. Of cource, all things will focus on to provide students real 
good service. Our goal is to build an app which really satisfy our students by providing best services.

	Invitation:
This is a real good idea, and this project needs some developers to join us. We invite you,
who really want to do some meaningful thing, some significative thing.
